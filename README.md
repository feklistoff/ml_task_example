# Overview

This is a project example where I build and train a model (classifier) to predict the target variable of a given anonymized dataset that contains a small set of features. 

**Goals of this Project:**

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Dataset engineering pipeline.
* Training and validation data splitting.
* Model selection, training, and evaluation.
* Results reporting and discussing.

## Create virtual environment 

NOTE: **Use python 3.9.9**

- `python -m venv ml_venv`
- `source ml_venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
